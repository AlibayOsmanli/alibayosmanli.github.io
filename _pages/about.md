I am a PhD researcher in the **Computer Vision Group** at Queen Mary University of London.  
My doctoral research focuses on **uncertainty estimation**, with an emphasis on quantifying epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

I hold an **MSc in Artificial Intelligence** from Queen Mary University of London, where I worked on projects in machine learning, computer vision, and statistical modeling. Prior to that, I completed my **BSc in Computer Engineering** at **Ko√ß University** (Istanbul, Turkey).  

My broader research interests lie at the intersection of **artificial intelligence, computer vision, and uncertainty estimation**, particularly in applications involving safety-critical decision-making.
